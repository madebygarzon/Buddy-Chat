## General Description

The **AvatarBuddy Redirect** plugin allows users to authenticate and redirect to the **AvatarBuddy** platform using a secure SSO (Single Sign-On) link. The plugin generates a unique token each time the user clicks the "Try Me" button. This button can be integrated into any page or post on your WordPress site using a shortcode.

The plugin ensures that users are redirected correctly by generating a new token each time they interact with the button. Additionally, the secret keys and URL used for authentication can be easily configured from the WordPress admin panel.
